# Procrastination  
After extensive data collection, Casey and I have gathered a data set regarding procrastination. This data set can be found in the `Data` folder within the `Analysis` folder.

## Project overview  
*Talk about our proposal in terms of what company we are presenting to and what our objectives are*  
Some of our main questions include the following:

* How many nations, if any, show up in both of these categories?  
* Is there a relationship between Age and Income?  If so, what are some potential reasons for this?  
* Is there a relationship between Life Satisfaction and HDI?
