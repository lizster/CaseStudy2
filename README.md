# Procrastination  
After extensive data collection, Casey and I have gathered a data set regarding procrastination. This data set can be found in the `Data` folder within the `Analysis` folder.  
## Project overview  
*Talk about our proposal in terms of what company we are presenting to and what our objectives are*  
Some of our main questions include the following:
* What are the top 15 nations in average procrastination scores? (In terms of DP, AIP, and GP)  
* How many nations, if any, show up in both of these categories?  
* Is there a relationship between Age and Income?  If so, what are some potential reasons for this?  
* Is there a relationship between Life Satisfaction and HDI?
