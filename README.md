# Procrastination  
After extensive data collection, Casey and I have gathered a data set regarding procrastination. This data set can be found in the `Data` folder within the `Analysis` folder.  

-Start by explaining the general problem and then talk about the web scraping and where we got the Procrastination data from   
-We want to make it reproducible (this is what GitHub is for)  
-Talk about how others view your sense of Procrastination

-Talk about how procrastination is effecting grades of MSDS students  
-How does age take into account  
-The client is just the program, but the data set is global to help generate an idea of worldwide Procrastination

## Repository Breakdown  
Within the root directory, you can find both the Rmarkdown file and the Markdown file which include the full analysis of our data.  

References:  
* `CaseStudy2.pdf`: a specific outline of how we proceeded through the project  
* `Checklist.txt`: a general outline of how we split up the tasks  

Analysis:  
* `MakeFile1.R`: the code we used to scrape more information from the web  
* `MakeFile2.R`: the code we used to merge and clean our data in order to make it tidy and ready for analysis  
* `Data`: a folder with the data used for analysis  

Data:  
* `Procrastination.csv`: the raw data (no XML)  
* `Procrastination2.csv`: the tidied data (with XML)  


## Project overview  
*Talk about our proposal in terms of what company we are presenting to and what our objectives are*  
Some of our main questions include the following:
* What are the top 15 nations in average procrastination scores? (In terms of DP, AIP, and GP)  
* How many nations, if any, show up in both of these categories?  
* Is there a relationship between Age and Income?  If so, what are some potential reasons for this? 
* Is there a relationship between Life Satisfaction and HDI?  
* Because the above two are not significant and not relevant to our question, we need to find a new question to ask
  * Try and find any correlations with Age or Education with DP, etc... in order to conclusion
  
* You could end up marketing more in certain countries with lower procrastinatin rates, etc...
